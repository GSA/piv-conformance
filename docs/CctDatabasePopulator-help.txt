The "final" Python script is attached. I finally tested on a smaller virtual environment. The steps to produce the virtual environment (on my Mac) were these:

cwallace $ python3.6 -m venv ~/venvcct
cwallace $ source ~/venvcct/bin/activate
(venvcct) cwallace$ pip install --upgrade pip

When I added the virtual environment to PyCharm it installed setuptools. The script itself needs just one other component to run: xlrd. Documentation for the xlrd library is here: https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/. It was installed as follows:

(venvcct) MacBook-Pro-RH-4:Downloads cwallace$ pip install xlrd 

The resulting virtual environment looks lie this:

(venvcct) cwallace$ pip freeze
xlrd==1.2.0
(venvcct) cwallace$ pip list installed
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        19.0.3 
setuptools 28.8.0 
xlrd       1.2.0 

The script can be executed from an activated prompt:

(venvcct) cwallace$ python CctDatabasePopulator.py -i ~/Downloads/exploded-cbeff.xlsx -o exploded-cbeff.sql

The script emits a file with SQL commands. The following can be executed to generate a sqlite database.

cwallace$ sqlite3 exploded-cbeff.db < exploded-cbeff.sql 

To interact with the database just load with sqlite3.

cwallace$ sqlite3 exploded-cbeff.db
SQLite version 3.9.2 2015-11-02 18:31:45
