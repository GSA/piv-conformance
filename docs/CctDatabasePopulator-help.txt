Also, just for information, here are the steps I needed to run the python script here:
 
python3 -mvenv venv-xlrd
source venv-xlrd/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install xlrd
pip install xlwt
pip install xlsxwriter

Note that I had to move the 85A tab to the end of the workbook in order for things to work. Modified sheet attached.
 
Bob, can you check that into your branch? I didn't want to create an unmergeable conflict for you by doing that myself.
 
I'll set about running these.

Just to underscore for anyone not accustomed to the python venv module... this command:
 
(venvcct) MacBook-Pro-RH-4:Downloads cwallace$ pip install xlrd 
 
must be run from the same command prompt where the venv was activated using its activate script... otherwise pip will attempt to install xlrd system-wide.

The "final" Python script is attached. I finally tested on a smaller virtual environment. The steps to produce the virtual environment (on my Mac) were these:
 
cwallace $ python3.6 -m venv ~/venvcct
cwallace $ source ~/venvcct/bin/activate
(venvcct) cwallace$ pip install --upgrade pip
 
When I added the virtual environment to PyCharm it installed setuptools. The script itself needs just one other component to run: xlrd. Documentation for the xlrd library is here: https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/. It was installed as follows:
 
(venvcct) MacBook-Pro-RH-4:Downloads cwallace$ pip install xlrd 
 
The resulting virtual environment looks lie this:
 
(venvcct) cwallace$ pip freeze
xlrd==1.2.0
(venvcct) cwallace$ pip list installed
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        19.0.3 
setuptools 28.8.0 
xlrd       1.2.0 
 
The script can be executed from an activated prompt:
 
(venvcct) cwallace$ python CctDatabasePopulator.py -i ~/Downloads/exploded-cbeff.xlsx -o exploded-cbeff.sql
 
The script emits a file with SQL commands. The following can be executed to generate a sqlite database.
 
cwallace$ sqlite3 exploded-cbeff.db < exploded-cbeff.sql 
 
To interact with the database just load with sqlite3.
 
cwallace$ sqlite3 exploded-cbeff.db
SQLite version 3.9.2 2015-11-02 18:31:45
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
